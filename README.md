# Sea Level Predictor

Sea Level Predictor is a Data Analysis with Python project from freeCodeCamp. Information and instructions can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/sea-level-predictor

The file epa-sea-level.csv contains data on sea level for every year from 1880 to 2013.
In this project, we are asked to:

1. Create a scatter plot of the Sea Level data from 1880-2013.
2. Use linear regression function (linregress) from scipy.stats library to fit:
   a. CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level from year 1880
   b. CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level from year 2000
4. Using the slope and intercept obtained from linear fitting, predict the sea level readings up to the year 2050
5. Add the two lines to the data scatter plot

<h3>Project Output:</h3>
Plot of yearly sea level readings and best fit lines<br>
Red line is the best fit line from 1880<br>
Green line is the best fit line from 2000<br>
